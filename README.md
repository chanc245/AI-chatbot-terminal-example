# Design Research 1: Methods - Research Toolkit

This Research Methods Toolkit—comprising both this document and a little chatbot I created—serves as a practical resource for conducting design research in the future. While I might not need to take courses like DR2 and Senior Capstone, research will inevitably play a role in my work, making this toolkit an invaluable asset. It brings together methodologies, tools, and reflections from the semester into an accessible and well-organized format, perfect for easy reference.
